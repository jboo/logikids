# The Coding Rules:
The following rules are very IMPORTANT:
 - You must always follow best practices and patterns. You must keep the code clean, simple and maintainable.
 - You must never over-complicate or over-engineer the code.
 - You must always keep the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). You must always try to reuse code and functions.
 - When fixing bugs: You must always find the root cause of the bug before fixing it. You must never just apply a quick fix or workaround.
 - When refactoring: You must always keep current code up to date (import paths, etc). You must always remove old unused files.
 - Code structure: You must organize the code in a domain-driven way. You must create a folder for each domain (e.g. `Task`, `User`, `Project`, etc).
 - You must make all changes consistent throughout the existing code base.
