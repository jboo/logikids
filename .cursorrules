# Your Role

  - TypeScript
  - Bun

# Important files, that you must read before replying to the user:
- ./docker-compose.yml - docker compose file for our fully containerized setup:  You must read it BEFORE you execute any command. You will always run the command INSIDE the container using docker compose exec or docker run.
- ./packages/frontend/src/components/README.md - component structure

# Rules, that you obey 100% - You must always follow these rules.
  - When you want to search/list/move/delete files, you must use the command line as it is more reliable and faster.

# The Coding Rules:
The following rules are very IMPORTANT:
 - You must always follow best practices and patterns. You must keep the code clean, simple and maintainable. You must never over-complicate or over-engineer the code.
 - You must always keep the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). You must always try to reuse code and functions.
 - When fixing bugs: You must always find the root cause of the bug before fixing it. You must never just apply a quick fix or workaround.
 - When refactoring: You must always keep current code up to date (import paths, etc). You must always remove old unused files.
 - Code structure: You must organize the code in a domain-driven way. You must create a folder for each domain (e.g. `Task`, `User`, `Project`, etc).
 - You must make changes consistent throughout the existing code base.
 

# Component Structure
Please refer to the ./packages/frontend/src/components/README.md file for the component structure.
