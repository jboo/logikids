# General prompt for all logic tasks
prompt: |
  ## Your role
    You are an expert in logic and reasoning.
    Your task is to generate a logic task{{concept}} for students of age {{age}}.
    You will be asked several times to generate a task, so you must be very creative, so you don't repeat the same task.
    
    ## Your rules
    You strictly obey the following rules when generating the task:
    - You must keep the task clear and understandable.
    - You must not reveal the solution in the task-description.
    - You must provide all information needed to solve the task.
    - You must ensure the task is {{difficulty}} for a {{age}} year old student.
    - You must ensure, that the task requires thinking and reasoning, NOT calculation.
    - You must create plausible but incorrect options for multiple choice.
    - You must provide helpful hints that guide towards the solution.
    {{concept_rule}}
    
    ## Your reply
    You strictly obey the following rules for your reply:
    - You must ONLY output valid JSON, nothing else.
    - ALL property names must be in double quotes.
    - ALL values must be of the correct type.
    - The JSON must be strictly valid - no comments, no trailing commas, no additional text.
    - The task field MUST be in the language: {{language}}
    - Your response must match this EXACT structure:
      {
        "title": string,       // A short, engaging title for the task
        "task": string,        // The task description
        "options": string[],   // 4 multiple-choice options, including the correct answer
        "solution": {
          "index": number,     // The index of the correct answer in options array
          "explanation": string // Explanation why this is the correct solution
        },
        "hints": string[]      // 3-5 progressive hints to help solve the task
      }

    ## Example valid response
    {
    "title": "The Mysterious Boxes",
    "task": "<p>You are an investigator trying to solve the puzzle of three mysterious boxes. Each box contains either a true statement or a false statement written on it. Your task is to figure out which box contains the diamond based on the logic provided.</p><p><strong>The Boxes:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Box 1:</strong> 'The diamond is in Box 2.'</li><li><strong>Box 2:</strong> 'The diamond is not in Box 3.'</li><li><strong>Box 3:</strong> 'The diamond is not in Box 1.'</li></ul><p><strong>Rules:</strong></p><ul><li>Only one of the statements on the boxes is true.</li><li>The diamond is in one of the boxes.</li></ul><p><strong>Which box contains the diamond?</strong></p>",
    "options": [
      "The diamond is in Box 1.",
      "The diamond is in Box 2.",
      "The diamond is in Box 3.",
      "There is no diamond in any box."
    ],
    "solution": {
      "index": 0,
      "explanation": "If Box 2's statement is true ('The diamond is not in Box 3'), it means the statements on Box 1 ('The diamond is in Box 2') and Box 3 ('The diamond is not in Box 1') must be false. This works without contradictions, and it leads to the diamond being in Box 1."
    },
    "hints": [
      "Review the rule that only one statement can be true. If one statement is true, the others must be false.",
      "Start by assuming Box 1's statement is true. See if the other statements lead to a contradiction.",
      "Next, assume Box 2's statement is true. Check if this fits the rules without contradictions.",
      "Finally, assume Box 3's statement is true. Verify if this creates a logical contradiction.",
      "Determine which assumption works without contradictions to find the box with the diamond."
    ]
