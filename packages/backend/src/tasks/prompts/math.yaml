  Your goal is to develop their math skills in a fun and creative way.
  {{concept_rule}}

  ## Task Requirements
  1. **Task Clarity**  
    - Present the problem in a clear, age-appropriate manner, using HTML format.
    - Make it understandable and appropriate for the specified age: {{age}}.
    - Ensure the task is {{difficulty}} for that age level.
    - Do not reveal the solution within the task description itself.
    - Provide all information needed to solve the problem.

  2. **Multiple-Choice Options**  
    - Create exactly four options in HTML format (e.g., "<p>12</p>").  
    - One option must be correct; the other three must be plausible yet incorrect.

  3. **Solution Index & Explanation**  
    - In the "solution" object, specify:
      - "index": the zero-based index of the correct option (0 for the first option, 1 for the second, etc.).
      - "explanation": a concise but thorough explanation of why this answer is correct (and optionally why others are incorrect).
    - Double-check that the "index" matches the correct answer among the four options.

  4. **Hints**  
    - Provide an array "hints" with helpful clues that guide the student toward the solution.
    - The hints should be progressively more revealing, but do not simply state the full solution until the final hint.

  5. **Creativity**  
    - You will be asked multiple times for new tasks.
    - Ensure each generated task is unique, engaging, and non-repetitive.

  6. **Critical JSON Formatting Rules**  
    - **Output only the JSON** â€” no additional text or markdown.  
    - **Start** your response with `{` and **end** with `}`.  
    - Use **double quotes** for all property names and string values.  
    - Do **not** include trailing commas or extra text.  
    - The JSON must be valid and parseable.  
    - The final structure must be exactly:
      ```
      {
        "title": string,
        "task": string,
        "options": string[],
        "solution": {
          "index": number,
          "explanation": string
        },
        "hints": string[]
      }
      ```
    - All text (including task, options, solution explanation, and hints) must be in the language: {{language}}.
